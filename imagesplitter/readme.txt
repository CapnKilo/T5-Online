Eclipse Origins - Image Splitter
Created by: Robin Perris

Using this program is very simple. All it does is take a single .bmp, .gif or .jpg file and splits it into rows and saves each row as a seperate file.

The main usage of this is for converting graphics from old versions of Eclipse to a format supported by Eclipse Origins.

Simply place your image file in '/original/', boot up the program, select your image file from the list, set the height of each row then which number you want the process to start from. (For example, if you already have 13 sprites, place 14 as the Start At number so it doesn't overwrite your sprites.)

When you've input all the data required, press 'Load Image'. Double-check the 'Properties' box to make sure it's all correct, then press 'Split Image'.

Watch the magic happen and enjoy the end result!
